# HASSUS

**Hassus** is not a game - it's an experience. Experience of sadness and laughter - as is life. One last laugh is all it takes to make an old duck happy. So bring your friends, gather around and fight to the last duck using laughable items and weapons. Leverage the fully destructible environment to your advantage as you try to tickle the funny bone of your opponent. Get laughing already!

The game was created in 48 hours during the Global Game Jam / Finnish Game Jam 2024.
